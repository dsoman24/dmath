# dmath: Python Math Library

Linear algebra calculators included in this library:
    - Echelon form and reduced row echelon form (RREF)
    - Matrix multiplication
    - Determinant of a square matrix
    - Inverse matrix
    - LU factorization
    - There are also additional functions to do with matrices, such as a function to create the identity matrix or a random matrix.

Other calculators/functions included in this library:
    - Polynomial multiplication
    - Float to fraction
    - Combinations n choose k
    - Euler's method algorithm for numerical integration
    - Function to check decimal places of a number
    - Newton's method algorithm to compute points of intersection between two functions as well as finding roots of functions
    - Recursive and iterative algorithms to compute Fibonacci numbers
    - Recursive and iterative algorithms to compute factorials
    - Limit definition of the first derivative with a given step size
    - Limit definition of the nth derivative with a given step size
    - Number system base changer

This library also has built in physics simulations under the physics-sim directory, which include:
- Radioactive decay
- Free fall with drag

TO DO:
- "Adaptive" order for Maclaurin series and "adaptive" number of iterations for Euler's method to give precise results for functions.
    - For instance, accuracy is lost at high values of x when number of iterations isn't high enough
- Research CORDIC algorithm!
